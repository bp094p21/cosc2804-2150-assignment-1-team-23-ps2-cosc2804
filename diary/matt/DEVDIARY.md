# Development Diary Activities 

**Week 1**

This list is in **no particular order**.
  * Read chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the Computer Architecture with Raspberry Pi's book. 
  * Completed number system conversion questions.
  * Wrote numerous guides to assist those having trouble with getting set up.
    - How does the Spigot API, Minecraft, RaspberryJuice and MC Python API work and interact.
    - What Java versions do you need, where to download them (plus personal recommendations) and which version of Minecraft & Spigot maps to which Java version.
    - How to alter the java command-line startup flags for the `start` executable, so that the 20-second cool down can be omitted and the second white Mojang server gui is not displayed. As well as how to close the server properly to avoid "this port is already in use" issue.
  * Setup Pycharm on my MacBook, and VSCode on my Windows laptop to allow familiarity when presenting code snippets to other team members. The programming is done on my MacBook, whilst running Minecraft and the Spigot Server is handled on the Windows machine. Files are shared via a dropbox server.
  * Forked RaspberryJuice and the Python Minecraft API to add in a setBiome() method, as well as clean up, restructure, update and improve the codebase. Wrote detailed documentation for the team on how to install this new forked version, to ensure a smooth transition.
  * Spent countless hours envisioning a design for a central framework, so that all components can work together smoothly. Drew a class diagram on paper, and various other forms of diagrams. See the excel document embedded within this directory for a high-level overview with lots of visuals.
  * Hosted a meeting discussing the framework design, and running through the idea to teammates, whilst being open to constructive criticism and alterations.
  * Discussed code conventions with team to ensure consistency, and organised project structure.
  * Collaborated with team to allocate duties, discuss central questions and design concerns, as well as to get a plan going.
  * Set up the discord server to be conducive to a team environment, with multiple channels dedicated to this project. Created a webhook to integrate into a particular channel "commit-log", so that all pushes and their commit messages are logged there. This way, the team can be notified when a someone pushes some changes, so that they can pull them before they begin their coding session, thereby, avoiding merge conflicts.
  * Implemented the bare bones of the framework; file structure, modules and some code, design patterns and decisions, and general layout.
